## Facts About the Universe

- The universe is around 13.8 billion years old, according to current estimates based on the rate of expansion.
- It contains billions of galaxies, each containing millions or even billions of stars.
- The observable universe is about 93 billion light-years in diameter.
- The cosmic microwave background radiation is the afterglow of the Big Bang and fills the entire universe.
- Dark matter and dark energy are thought to make up approximately 95% of the total content of the universe.

## Facts About the Solar System

- Our solar system is located in the Milky Way galaxy and is about 4.6 billion years old.
- There are eight known planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
- Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a mass one-thousandth that of the sun but two and a half times that of all the other planets combined.

## Fact of the Earth

- The real Earth has a circumference of about 40,075 kilometers.
- Earth is the only known planet to support life, with its unique atmosphere and distance from the sun being key factors.
- Our planet's rotation is gradually slowing, causing the days to get longer over time.
- Earth's core is as hot as the surface of the sun, with temperatures estimated to be between 5,000 and 7,000 degrees Celsius.
- The Earth's magnetic field helps protect us from harmful solar radiation and is responsible for the auroras near the poles.

## Facts About the Moon

- The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and is about 1/4 the diameter of Earth.
- It is about 384,400 km from Earth, and it takes about 27.3 days to orbit our planet.
- The same side of the Moon always faces Earth due to tidal locking.
- There are more than 300,000 craters wider than 1 km on the Moon's surface.

## Facts About Mars

- Mars is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance, which is due to iron oxide (rust) on its surface.
- It has the tallest mountain in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which is a shield volcano about 21 km high.
- Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are thought to be captured asteroids.
- Future technologies, such as more powerful propulsion systems or planned missions like NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) and SpaceX's Starship, aim to reduce transit time to Mars potentially down to around 6 months or possibly even less for crewed missions.
